# PingFederate Go Client

This repository contains a Go client for interacting with the PingFederate admin API. It is generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

For a client tied to a specific version, add a version qualifier matching the PingFederate version to your `require` in `go.mod`.

For example, for a client for PingFederate 11.2.5:
```
require github.com/pingidentity/pingfederate-go-client/v1125 v1125.6.0
```

The `.6.0` refers to the version of this client module.
